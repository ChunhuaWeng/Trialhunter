>>NCT01119638
Inclusion Criteria :.
 Eligible participants will fulfill criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer's type ( according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition ). The score on the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) has to be between 5 and 26.

 Exclusion Criteria :.
 Patients will be excluded if they had received a diagnosis of a primary psychotic disorder ( e.g., schizophrenia ), delirium, other dementia.
