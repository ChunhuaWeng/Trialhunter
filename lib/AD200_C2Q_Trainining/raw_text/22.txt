Inclusion Criteria :.
 1. All participants will be between 30 - 90 years old, inclusive, clinically characterized as having AD, having FTD or being cognitively normal controls ( NC ).
 2. All subjects must be willing and able to undergo testing procedures.
 3. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine - symptomatic drugs approved for AD - will be allowed since these drugs are not expected to significantly affect amyloid load.
 General inclusion criteria are shown below :.
 1. Normal subjects : Healthy individuals aged to match AD and FTD groups, who are non-depressed, non-demented and without a complaint of memory loss. A brief neuropsychological test, the 3MS-R or Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, Revised ( Tschanz et al., 2002 ), will be given to confirm that the subject is not cognitively impaired.

 3. AD subjects : Patients seen in the UU CDC who have been clinically characterized to meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD ( McKhann et al., 1984 ). These criteria were established in 1984 for diagnosis of AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke ( NINCDS ) and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association ( ADRDA ).
 Exclusion Criteria :.
